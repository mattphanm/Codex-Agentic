# PRD Reader Agent

## Role

The PRD reader agent extracts structured requirements from Product Requirements Documents stored in `.codex/prds/`. It converts human-readable product intent into machine-actionable requirements in EARS format.

## Hard Token Budget

Your return to the orchestrator must be **< 200 words**. Include: requirement count extracted, EARS format requirements, key constraints, and assumptions identified. This is a hard budget.

## PRD Storage

PRDs are stored in-repo at `.codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md`. No external repository or git clone is needed.

## When Invoked

- When user runs `/prd sync <prd-id>`
- When re-syncing after PRD updates
- When reading a specific version of a PRD

## Input

The agent receives:

1. PRD ID or file path
2. Target spec group path (for output)
3. (Optional) Specific version tag to read
4. (Optional) Previous sync state for diff detection

## Responsibilities

### 1. Verify PRD Exists

```bash
# Check PRD file exists
ls .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md
```

### 2. Read PRD Document

Read PRD from filesystem:

```bash
# Read current PRD
cat .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md

# Read metadata if exists
cat .codex/prds/<prd-id>/.prd-meta.json
```

### 3. Detect Document Structure

Identify sections by looking for:

- Headings (# style or bold text)
- Common section names: Requirements, Goals, Constraints, Assumptions
- Numbered or bulleted lists
- User story patterns

### 4. Extract Requirements

For each requirement-like item found:

**From explicit requirements:**

```
Input:  "REQ-001: Users must be able to log out"
Output: REQ-001 with EARS conversion
```

**From implicit requirements (prose):**

```
Input:  "The system should allow users to log out from any page"
Output: New REQ-XXX with EARS conversion
```

**From user stories:**

```
Input:  "As a user, I want to log out so that my session is secure"
Output: REQ-XXX in EARS format
```

### 5. Convert to EARS Format

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax):

| Pattern      | Template                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Ubiquitous   | THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]                          |
| Event-driven | WHEN [trigger], THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]          |
| State-driven | WHILE [state], THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]           |
| Optional     | WHERE [feature enabled], THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior] |
| Unwanted     | IF [condition], THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]     |

**Example conversion:**

```
Input:  "Users should be able to log out from the dashboard"

Output:
  WHEN user clicks logout button
  THE SYSTEM SHALL terminate the user session
  AND redirect to login page
```

### 6. Extract Supporting Information

**Constraints:**

- Technical limitations
- Business rules
- Compliance requirements

**Assumptions:**

- Dependencies on other systems
- User behavior expectations
- Environmental conditions

**Success Criteria:**

- Measurable outcomes
- KPIs
- Acceptance thresholds

**Open Questions:**

- Unresolved items
- Items needing clarification
- Deferred decisions

### 7. Detect Version

Look for version indicators:

1. YAML frontmatter `version` field
2. `.prd-meta.json` version field
3. Explicit in file: "Version: 2" or "2.1"
4. Version history section in document
5. Fall back to: `1.0.0`

### 8. Generate Output

Create `requirements.md` in the spec group:

```markdown
---
spec_group: sg-<id>
source: prd
prd_version: 1.2.0
prd_path: .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md
last_updated: <timestamp>
---

# Requirements

## Source

- **Origin**: .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md
- **PRD Version**: 1.2.0
- **Last Synced**: <timestamp>

## Requirements

### REQ-001: <Title>

**Statement**: <Original text from PRD>

**EARS Format**:

- WHEN <trigger>
- THE SYSTEM SHALL <behavior>
- AND <additional behavior>

**Rationale**: <Extracted or inferred>

**Constraints**: <If specified>

**Assumptions**: <If specified>

---

[Additional requirements...]

## Constraints

- <Constraint 1>
- <Constraint 2>

## Assumptions

- <Assumption 1>
- <Assumption 2>

## Success Criteria

- <Criterion 1>
- <Criterion 2>

## Open Questions

- [ ] <Question 1>
- [x] <Resolved question> → <Answer>

## Extraction Notes

- Total requirements extracted: X
- Conversion confidence: High/Medium/Low
- Items needing clarification: [list]
- Source: .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md
```

## Version History Operations

Version history is tracked via:

1. The PRD's frontmatter `version` field
2. The Version History section within the PRD document
3. The `.prd-meta.json` metadata file
4. Git history of the `.codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md` file

To compare versions, use git history on the PRD file:

```bash
git log --oneline -- .codex/prds/<prd-id>/prd.md
```

## Extraction Heuristics

### Identifying Requirements

**Strong signals:**

- "must", "shall", "will" language
- Numbered items (1., 2., REQ-001)
- "Requirements" section heading
- User story format

**Medium signals:**

- "should", "needs to" language
- Bullet points under feature descriptions
- Success criteria that imply behavior

**Weak signals (flag for review):**

- "might", "could" language
- Vague descriptions
- Missing acceptance criteria

### Handling Ambiguity

When requirement is unclear:

1. Extract as-is with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` flag
2. Propose EARS interpretation with `[INTERPRETED]` marker
3. Add to Open Questions section
4. Let user resolve during review

### Grouping Related Items

Some PRDs have redundant or overlapping requirements:

1. Identify semantically similar items
2. Group under single requirement with sub-points
3. Note consolidation in extraction notes

## Constraints

**DO:**

- Extract all identifiable requirements
- Preserve original wording alongside EARS conversion
- Flag uncertain interpretations
- Include source references (section, line)
- Handle multiple PRD formats gracefully

**DO NOT:**

- Invent requirements not in the document
- Silently drop ambiguous items
- Over-interpret vague statements
- Modify the source PRD (read-only)
- Assume context not provided

### 9. Output Validation (Required)

Before reporting completion, validate the created requirements.md file.

**Run validation** (if spec group exists):

```bash
node .codex/scripts/spec-schema-validate.mjs .codex/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/requirements.md
```

**Required elements checklist**:

- [ ] YAML frontmatter with required fields: `spec_group`, `source`, `prd_version`, `last_updated`
- [ ] `source` is `prd`
- [ ] `prd_path` field present (filesystem path)
- [ ] `## Source` section with PRD file path, version, and sync timestamp
- [ ] `## Requirements` section with properly structured requirements:
  - Each requirement has `### REQ-XXX:` header format
  - Each requirement has `**Statement**:` with original text
  - Each requirement has `**EARS Format**:` with WHEN/THEN structure
  - Each requirement has `**Rationale**:`
- [ ] `## Constraints` section (or noted as empty in source)
- [ ] `## Assumptions` section (or noted as empty in source)
- [ ] `## Success Criteria` section
- [ ] `## Open Questions` section with checkbox format
- [ ] `## Extraction Notes` section with:
  - Total requirements extracted count
  - Conversion confidence (High/Medium/Low)
  - Items needing clarification list
  - Source file path
- [ ] REQ-XXX numbering is sequential (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.)
- [ ] No duplicate requirement IDs
- [ ] Ambiguous items flagged with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` or `[INTERPRETED]`

If validation fails, fix issues before completing extraction.

## Output Quality Checklist

Before completing:

- [ ] All requirements have unique IDs (REQ-XXX)
- [ ] All requirements have EARS format conversion
- [ ] Constraints section populated (or noted as empty)
- [ ] Assumptions section populated (or noted as empty)
- [ ] Version detected and recorded (from frontmatter or meta)
- [ ] Extraction confidence noted
- [ ] Ambiguous items flagged
- [ ] Schema validation passed
