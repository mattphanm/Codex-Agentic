# Agentic System Restoration

## Context

The monorepo underwent a migration from `agents/` to `.codex/` directory structure (commit 53a279d). While the new structure provides better Codex integration with native skills and subagents, valuable documentation and automation was lost:

- **OPERATOR-GUIDE.md**: 285-line human operator documentation with workflow decision tree and operational insights
- **Memory Bank System**: Persistent project knowledge (`project.brief.md`, `tech.context.md`, `testing.guidelines.md`, best practices library)
- **Automation Scripts**: `spec-validate.mjs`, `reset-active-context.mjs`, `load-context.mjs`, `manage-worktrees.mjs`
- **Contract Registry**: Ownership tracking for multi-workstream contracts

A recovery report with full file contents exists at `.codex/specs/active/recovery-report.md`.

## Goal

Restore the highest-value components from the old system into the new `.codex/` structure while avoiding redundancy and maintenance burden. The restored system should support frequent orchestrator workflow usage and be understandable by both Codex and human operators.

## Requirements (EARS Format)

### Condensed Operator Guide

- **WHEN** a human operator needs to understand the agentic workflow system
- **THEN** the system shall provide a condensed guide at `.codex/OPERATOR-GUIDE.md`
- **AND** the guide shall include a workflow decision tree (orchestrator vs oneoff-spec vs oneoff-vibe)
- **AND** the guide shall include all 10 "Nuances & Gotchas" operational insights
- **AND** the guide shall be under 80 lines to minimize maintenance drift

### Memory Bank System

- **WHEN** Codex or a human needs project context
- **THEN** the system shall provide a memory bank at `.codex/memory-bank/`
- **AND** the memory bank shall include `project.brief.md` with project overview
- **AND** the memory bank shall include `tech.context.md` with technical stack documentation
- **AND** the memory bank shall include `testing.guidelines.md` with testing patterns
- **AND** the memory bank shall include `best-practices/` directory with domain-specific guidance
- **AND** `AGENTS.md` shall include a retrieval policy documenting when to load each file

### Automation Scripts

- **WHEN** a user creates a new task spec
- **THEN** `reset-active-context.mjs` shall scaffold a new spec from template
- **AND** the script shall be located at `.codex/scripts/reset-active-context.mjs`

- **WHEN** a user validates a spec
- **THEN** `spec-validate.mjs` shall check spec compliance against schemas
- **AND** the script shall be located at `.codex/scripts/spec-validate.mjs`

- **WHEN** a user needs to load context files
- **THEN** `load-context.mjs` shall load specified files with line numbers
- **AND** the script shall be located at `.codex/scripts/load-context.mjs`

- **WHEN** a user manages git worktrees for orchestrator workflow
- **THEN** `manage-worktrees.mjs` shall list, create, and cleanup worktrees
- **AND** the script shall be located at `.codex/scripts/manage-worktrees.mjs`

### Contract Registry

- **WHEN** multiple workstreams share interfaces
- **THEN** the system shall track contract ownership in `.codex/contracts/registry.yaml`
- **AND** the registry shall include contract ID, type, owner workstream, and file path
- **AND** the registry shall NOT include versioning (lightweight approach)

### Cleanup

- **WHEN** the restoration is complete
- **THEN** duplicate scripts in `agents/scripts/` shall be removed
- **AND** `sync-worktree-env-keys.mjs` shall be moved to `.codex/scripts/` or documented
- **AND** the `agents/` directory shall be removed if empty

## Acceptance Criteria

### Operator Guide (AC1)

- AC1.1: `.codex/OPERATOR-GUIDE.md` exists with workflow decision tree
- AC1.2: All 10 "Nuances & Gotchas" are included verbatim or adapted
- AC1.3: Guide is under 80 lines total
- AC1.4: Guide references skills (`/route`, `/spec`, `/implement`) not old workflow files

### Memory Bank (AC2)

- AC2.1: `.codex/memory-bank/project.brief.md` exists with project overview

- AC2.3: `.codex/memory-bank/testing.guidelines.md` exists with testing patterns
- AC2.4: `.codex/memory-bank/best-practices/` contains at least `typescript.md` and `software-principles.md`
- AC2.5: `AGENTS.md` includes retrieval policy section documenting when to load each memory bank file

### Automation Scripts (AC3)

- AC3.1: `.codex/scripts/reset-active-context.mjs` creates new spec from template

- AC3.4: `.codex/scripts/manage-worktrees.mjs` supports list/create/cleanup operations
- AC3.5: All scripts use new `.codex/` paths (not old `agents/` paths)

### Contract Registry (AC4)

- AC4.1: `.codex/contracts/registry.yaml` exists with lightweight structure
- AC4.2: Registry includes: id, type, owner, path fields (no version field)
- AC4.3: Example contract entry is included

### Cleanup (AC5)

- AC5.1: `agents/scripts/check-*.mjs` duplicates are removed (already in `.codex/scripts/`)
- AC5.2: `agents/scripts/sync-worktree-env-keys.mjs` is moved to `.codex/scripts/`
- AC5.3: `agents/` directory is removed or only contains intentionally preserved files

## Design Notes

```

### Script Adaptations Required

Scripts from old system need path updates:

- `agents/specs/` → `.codex/specs/`
- `agents/memory-bank/` → `.codex/memory-bank/`
- `agents/contracts/` → `.codex/contracts/`
- `agents/scripts/` → `.codex/scripts/`

### Retrieval Policy (for AGENTS.md)

```markdown
## Memory Bank Retrieval Policy

| File                                    | Load When                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `project.brief.md`                      | Starting new major feature, onboarding            |
| `tech.context.md`                       | Making architectural decisions, choosing patterns |
| `testing.guidelines.md`                 | Writing tests, reviewing test coverage            |
| `best-practices/typescript.md`          | TypeScript-specific implementation questions      |
| `best-practices/software-principles.md` | Design pattern decisions                          |
```

## Test Plan

This is primarily a documentation and tooling restoration task. Verification is manual:

- AC1.1-1.4 → Manual review: OPERATOR-GUIDE.md exists, contains decision tree, contains gotchas, under 80 lines, references skills
- AC2.1-2.4 → Manual review: Memory bank files exist with expected content
- AC2.5 → Manual review: AGENTS.md includes retrieval policy
- AC3.1 → Run: `node .codex/scripts/reset-active-context.mjs --help` succeeds
- AC3.2 → Run: `node .codex/scripts/spec-validate.mjs .codex/specs/active/*.md` succeeds
- AC3.3 → Run: `node .codex/scripts/load-context.mjs .codex/memory-bank/project.brief.md` outputs with line numbers
- AC3.4 → Run: `node .codex/scripts/manage-worktrees.mjs list` succeeds
- AC3.5 → Grep: No references to `agents/` paths in `.codex/scripts/*.mjs`
- AC4.1-4.3 → Manual review: registry.yaml exists with correct structure
- AC5.1-5.3 → Verify: `agents/` directory is removed or empty
