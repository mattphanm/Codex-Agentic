# Technical Context

Stacks & Tooling

- Node.js + TypeScript, Express, Effect, Zod, JWT.
- AWS SDK v3, CDKTF (OpenTofu/Terraform compatible).
- Turborepo, Vite, ESLint flat config.

Constraints

- TypeScript modules across packages; keep builds and configs consistent.
- Keep changes minimal and localized; adhere to repo style.

Environment

- Local dev for the server; CDKTF for infra with outputs consumed by the app.
- Worktree env keys: `.env.keys` are untracked; use `node .codex/scripts/sync-worktree-env-keys.mjs` (add `--overwrite` to replace existing files) for a single worktree or `node .codex/scripts/manage-worktrees.mjs sync` to refresh all worktrees (overwrites existing `.env.keys` and `cdktf-outputs` files). `manage-worktrees.mjs ensure` also syncs `cdk/platform-cdk/cdktf-outputs` when present, and use the `dotenvx-run.mjs` wrapper for missing-key hints.
- Optional: use `git worktree` to keep parallel changes isolated (e.g. hidden repo-local `.worktrees/{admin,backend,client}` on `worktree/*` branches).
- When you hit a `"package not found"` error, run `npm run install` at the repo root and retry first.

Entrypoints

- Server: `apps/node-server/src/index.ts` (dev) | `apps/node-server/src/lambda.ts` (Lambda)
- Infra: `cdk/platform-cdk/src/index.ts`

Where To Look First

- Handlers: `apps/node-server/src/handlers/*`
- Schemas: `packages/core/schemas/schemas/**/*`
- Infra stacks: `cdk/platform-cdk/src/stacks/**/*`

Codebase Map

- `apps/node-server`: Express app, middleware, handlers, Lambda wrapper.
- `cdk/platform-cdk`: CDKTF stacks (API, analytics, client website), consumers, outputs loader.
- `packages/core/backend-core`: Effect→Express adapter, services, types.
- `packages/core/schemas`: Zod domain schemas and constants.
- Shared configs: `packages/configs/*`.
- Shared UI: `packages/core/ui-components` exports reusable React components/styles for the web apps; CSS module typings are generated via `gen:css-types` (watch in `dev`) into `__generated__/src`.

Tech Stack Details

- Validation: Zod 4 for inputs and env `apps/node-server/src/types/environment.ts`.
- Effects: Effect 3 for typed effects/layers/errors `packages/core/backend-core`.
- Auth: JWT with custom claims `packages/core/schemas/schemas/user/userToken.ts` (optional; can be ejected via `npm run eject:users`); role constants in `packages/core/backend-core/src/auth/roles.ts`, admin enforcement via `apps/node-server/src/middleware/isAdmin.middleware.ts`.
- Build: Vite SSR to CJS; TS strict, shared configs.

Workflows

- Repo: build/lint/clean via turborepo scripts.
- App (node-server): `dev`, `build`, `preview`, env management via dotenvx.
- Infra (CDKTF): deploy/synth/destroy per stage; outputs written and consumed by app.

Task Recipes

- Add endpoint: define schema → implement handler using `parseInput` → wrap with `generateRequestHandler` → wire route → run dev.
- Add table/GSI: update schema constants → add stack changes → deploy → load outputs → update app client.
- Add middleware: implement Effect middleware → wrap as `RequestHandler` → register in server entry.

Scaffolding

- Repository scaffolding scripts live under `scripts/**`; `scripts/create-repository-service.mjs` is a thin wrapper over a config-driven runner defined in `scripts/scaffolds/repository-service.config.json` plus shared utilities in `scripts/utils/**`.
- Reusable hooks register via `scripts/utils/hooks.mjs`; configs declare which hooks run per stage (`preScaffold`, `renderTemplates`, `postScaffold`) and map template tokens to resolvers.
- Aspect ejection codemods live under `scripts/eject-aspect.mjs` with per-aspect definitions in `scripts/aspects/*.aspect.mjs` (e.g., `npm run eject:analytics`, `npm run eject:users`).

## Codex Orchestration Framework

The following sections describe the Codex agent orchestration framework used across all projects. This is the shared infrastructure for specs, subagents, validation hooks, and workflow coordination.

### Architecture Overview

The system is organized around the `.codex/` directory structure:

### Subagent Model

20 specialized subagents, each with focused responsibilities:

| Subagent                 | Model | Purpose                                                                                    |

| `test-writer`            | opus  | Write tests for acceptance criteria                                                        |

| `prd-amender`            | opus  | Push implementation discoveries back to PRDs (D-028 amendment format)                      |

### Spec is Contract Principle

**The spec is the authoritative source of truth.**

- Implementation must conform to spec
- Tests must verify spec requirements
- Any deviation requires spec amendment first (never deviate silently)
- Unifier validates alignment before approval

### Spec System Workflow

```
oneoff-spec:  TaskSpec → Investigate (MANDATORY, mode: single-spec) → Approve → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-implementation) → Implement + Test → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-test) → Integration Verify → Unify → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-review) → Code Review → Security → Completion Verify
orchestrator: WorkstreamSpecs → Atomize → Enforce → Investigate (MANDATORY, mode: standard) → Approve → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-orchestration) → Implement + Test → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-test) → Integration Verify → Unify → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-review) → Code Review → Security → Completion Verify
```

### Spec Types

- **TaskSpec**: Single-feature specifications for medium tasks
- **WorkstreamSpec**: Component of a larger orchestrated effort
- **MasterSpec**: Coordinates multiple workstreams with contracts

### Spec Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial authoring from requirements
2. **Atomized**: Decomposed into atomic specs (orchestrator workflows only)
3. **Enforced**: Validated against atomicity criteria (orchestrator workflows only)
4. **Approved**: User-approved, ready for implementation
5. **Implementing**: Work in progress
6. **Implemented**: All atomic specs complete
7. **Verified**: Unifier confirmed convergence

### Validation Hooks

PostToolUse hooks run automatically after Edit/Write operations to catch issues early. Key hooks include:

| Hook                         | Trigger                 | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `typescript-typecheck`       | `*.ts,*.tsx`            | Type checking via workspace-aware tsc       |
| `eslint-check`               | `*.ts,*.tsx,*.js,*.jsx` | Linting via workspace-aware ESLint          |
| `json-validate`              | `*.json`                | JSON syntax validation                      |
| `codex-md-drift`            | `*AGENTS.md`            | Detect AGENTS.md drift from canonical base  |
| `manifest-validate`          | `*manifest.json`        | Validate manifest against spec-group schema |
| `template-validate`          | `.codex/templates/*`   | Validate template structure                 |
| `registry-hash-verify`       | `.codex/**`            | Artifact hash verification                  |
| `agent-frontmatter-validate` | `.codex/agents/*.md`   | Agent frontmatter schema validation         |
| `skill-frontmatter-validate` | `*SKILL.md`             | Skill frontmatter schema validation         |
| `spec-schema-validate`       | `.codex/specs/**/*.md` | JSON schema validation for specs            |
| `spec-validate`              | `.codex/specs/**/*.md` | Spec markdown structure validation          |

Hooks warn but don't block (graceful degradation). For full documentation, see `.codex/docs/HOOKS.md`.

### Workflow Types

#### oneoff-vibe (Small tasks)

```
Request → Route → Delegate to subagent → Synthesize → Commit
```

- Simple changes with clear scope
- No formal spec required
- Single subagent dispatch

#### oneoff-spec (Medium tasks)

```
Request → Route → /prd (gather-criticize loop) → [Optional: PRD Draft] → Spec →
  Investigate (MANDATORY, mode: single-spec) → Approve →
  Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-implementation) →
  [Parallel: Implement + Test] →
  Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-test) → Integration Verify → Unify →
  Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-review) →
  Code Review → Security →
  Completion Verification →
  [If UI: Browser Test] → [If public API: Docs] → [If PRD: PRD Push] → Commit
```

- Requires formal specification
- No atomization step (TaskSpec is implemented directly)
- Investigation is MANDATORY (single-spec mode: Category 7, env/dep, external surfaces)
- Parallel implementation and testing
- Full review chain

#### orchestrator (Large tasks)

```
Request → Route → /prd (gather-criticize loop) → [Optional: PRD Draft] → ProblemBrief →
  [Parallel: WorkstreamSpecs] → MasterSpec →
  Investigate (MANDATORY for multi-workstream) → Resolve Decisions →
  Approve → Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-orchestration) →
  /orchestrate (allocates worktrees, dispatches facilitator) →
  [Parallel per workstream: Implement + Test] →
  Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-test) → Integration Verify →
  Unify →
  Challenge (MANDATORY, stage: pre-review) →
  Code Review → Security → Completion Verification →
  Browser Test → Docs → [If PRD: PRD Push] → Commit
```

- 3+ workstreams
- Git worktree isolation
- Cross-workstream contract validation

**Investigation Checkpoint**: `/investigate` is MANDATORY before implementation for both oneoff-spec (mode: `single-spec`) and orchestrator (mode: `standard`) workflows. It surfaces cross-boundary inconsistencies (env vars, API contracts, deployment assumptions) that would otherwise become runtime bugs.

**Challenger Stages**: `/challenge` is MANDATORY at four workflow stages: `pre-implementation` (after approve, before impl), `pre-test` (after impl, before test verification), `pre-review` (after unify, before code review), and `pre-orchestration` (after approve, before /orchestrate -- orchestrator only). Each is a single-pass check, not a convergence gate.

### Branch Naming Convention

Spec-based work uses the branch naming pattern `sg-<feature-name>/<action>`:

- **Pattern**: `sg-<feature-name>/<action>`
- **Examples**:
  - `sg-selective-context-copy/implement` - Implementation of selective copy feature
  - `sg-auth-system/fix-logout` - Fix for auth system logout
  - `sg-e2e-add-file/implement` - E2E test implementation

**Purpose**: This convention enables spec derivation from branch names. The spec group ID is the first path segment (e.g., `sg-auth-system` from `sg-auth-system/fix-logout`). Branches not matching the `sg-*` pattern are not spec-linked.

### Session State

Cross-session recovery via `.codex/context/session.json`:

```json
{
  "phase_checkpoint": {
    "phase": "implementing",
    "atomic_specs_pending": ["as-003", "as-004"],
    "atomic_specs_complete": ["as-001", "as-002"],
    "last_completed": "as-002"
  }
}
```

### Key File Locations

| Artifact          | Location                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Active specs      | `.codex/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/`              |
| Atomic specs      | `.codex/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/`       |
| Manifest          | `.codex/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/manifest.json` |
| Session state     | `.codex/context/session.json`                       |
| Agent definitions | `.codex/agents/<agent-name>.md`                     |
| Skill definitions | `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`               |

### Progress Heartbeat Discipline (Practice 4.2)

Long-running spec implementations must emit periodic progress signals. The `progress-heartbeat-check` hook enforces this automatically:

- Monitors `last_progress_update` timestamp in the spec group's `manifest.json`
- **Warning** at 15 minutes of silence — reminds the agent to log progress
- **Block** after 3 warnings — further edits are blocked until progress is logged
- Logging progress resets the warning counter to 0

Agents working on spec-based tasks should update progress in the manifest before the heartbeat triggers. This prevents silent stalls where an agent appears active but has stopped making meaningful progress.

### Independent Verification (Practice 2.4)

When `implementer` and `test-writer` run in parallel, the test-writer **must not see the implementation**. This is the spec-derived independent verification constraint:

- The test-writer receives only the **spec** (acceptance criteria, task list, evidence table) — never implementation file paths or code
- Tests are derived from the spec's acceptance criteria, not from reading implementation details
- This ensures tests verify the _contract_, not the _implementation_ — catching cases where code passes its own logic but violates the spec

When dispatching in parallel, the orchestrator must provide the test-writer with the spec artifact only. If the test-writer needs to understand interfaces or types, those should come from the spec's evidence table or contract definitions, not from implementation files.

### Assumption Tracking (Practice 1.10)

When multiple agents implement in parallel, each agent's `TODO(assumption)` comments create a distributed assumption graph. After parallel implementation and before the review gate, the orchestrator MUST scan modified files for `TODO(assumption)` markers, group by topic, and flag conflicts (two agents assumed different values for the same integration point). A single agent's assumption is a local decision; multiple agents' assumptions about the same topic are a distributed consensus problem.

### Parallel Execution

For large tasks, the main agent orchestrates parallel execution:

- Multiple `spec-author` subagents for workstreams
- `implementer` and `test-writer` run in parallel
- `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer` run in parallel
- Main agent handles integration and synthesis

### Convergence Gates

Before merge, all gates must pass. Each gate marked with **(loop)** runs under the Convergence Loop Protocol — requiring 2 consecutive clean passes, not single-pass:

- Spec complete and approved
- All ACs implemented
- All tests passing (100% AC coverage)
- Unifier validation passed **(loop)**
- Code review passed (no High/Critical issues) **(loop)**
- Security review passed **(loop)**
- Completion verification passed **(loop)**
- Browser tests passed (if UI)
- Documentation generated (if public API)

### Example Workflow: oneoff-spec (Logout Button)

```markdown
User: "Add a logout button to the dashboard"

1. `/route` → oneoff-spec (medium complexity)
2. Use `/prd` to gather requirements about placement, behavior, error handling
3. Dispatch Spec-author subagent → Create TaskSpec with 4 ACs, 6 tasks
4. [If spec references auth system] Dispatch Interface-investigator →
   Surface any conflicts with existing auth contracts
5. User approves spec (after resolving any investigation findings)
6. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-implementation)
7. [Parallel] Dispatch Implementer + Test-writer subagents
8. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-test)
9. Integration Verify → Dispatch Unifier subagent → Validate convergence
10. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-review)
11. [Parallel] Dispatch Code-reviewer + Security-reviewer subagents
12. Dispatch Browser-tester subagent → UI testing
13. Dispatch Documenter subagent → Generate API docs
14. Synthesize results → Commit with spec evidence
```

### Example Workflow: Multi-Workstream with Investigation

```markdown
User: "Build a deployment pipeline with build, deploy, and monitoring"

1. `/route` → orchestrator (3 workstreams)
2. Use `/prd` to gather requirements for each workstream
3. [Parallel] Dispatch 3 Spec-author subagents → Create WorkstreamSpecs
4. Create MasterSpec linking workstreams
5. `/investigate ms-deployment-pipeline` → MANDATORY checkpoint
   - Finds: GIT_SSH_KEY_PATH vs GIT_SSH_KEY_BASE64 conflict
   - Finds: Missing LOG\_\* vars in monitoring workstream
   - Finds: Container image format inconsistency
6. Surface decisions to user → User chooses canonical patterns
7. Update affected specs with decisions
8. Re-run `/investigate` → Clean (no issues)
9. User approves MasterSpec
10. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-orchestration)
11. [Parallel per workstream] Dispatch Implementer + Test-writer
12. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-test)
13. Integration Verify → Unify → Validate convergence
14. `/challenge` → MANDATORY operational feasibility check (stage: pre-review)
15. Continue with Code Review → Security → Docs → Commit
```

### S-DLC Team Relationship

When the S-DLC system is active, teams operate as a coordination layer above the skills/agents defined here:

- Teams wrap existing agents (composition, not replacement)
- Deliberation happens at team level; execution via agents
- Skills emit lifecycle events for dashboard observability (planned, not yet implemented)
- Local development works identically with or without S-DLC

See `.codex/journal/decisions/decision-001-sdlc-local-system-unification.md` for the full architectural decision.
